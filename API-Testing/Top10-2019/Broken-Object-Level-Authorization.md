### API1:2019 - Broken Object Level Authorization<br>
Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) in API security is when a system doesn't properly check if a user is allowed to access certain data. <br>
Imagine you have a key that opens your house, but it also opens your neighbor's house. This is a problem because you should only be able to access your own house. <br>
In BOLA, the system mistakenly allows users to access other people's data, like being able to use your key to open someone elseâ€™s house. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.<br>

<br>
#### OWASP Description:<br>
APIs tend to expose endpoints that handle object identifiers, creating a wide attack surface Level Access Control issue. Object level authorization checks should be considered in every function that accesses a data source using an input from the user.<br>
