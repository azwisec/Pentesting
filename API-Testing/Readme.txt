Penetration testing (pen testing) of APIs involves systematically assessing the security vulnerabilities of an API to identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. 

What is an API in simple?
An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, is like a waiter at a restaurant. 
When you go to a restaurant, you don't go into the kitchen and cook your own food. Instead, you tell the waiter what you want, and the waiter goes to the kitchen, gets your food, and brings it back to you.

Similarly, an API is like a waiter that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. Instead of one software program having to understand all the details of how another program works, they can use an API as a middleman to request and exchange information.



Why should we test our APIs?
Penetration testing (pen-testing) of APIs is crucial for several reasons.
