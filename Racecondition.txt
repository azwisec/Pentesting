WHAT IS RACE CONDITION

Race conditions are vulnerabilities that appear in webs that limit the number of times you can perform an action.

For example, let’s think of a playground that has a swing game, but this time there is a vulnerability that makes the time limit rule not applied properly.

Imagine there are two children who want to use the swing at the same time. They compete to get the first turn. However, there is no monitoring mechanism that ensures that only one child can use the swing at a time. This creates a race condition vulnerability in the playground.

Now, let’s apply this to a website that has a feature that limits the number of actions that can be performed. For example, there is a website where users are given a daily quota to perform certain actions, such as sending messages or uploading files.
