How toe exploit on account creation?(sign up page)
-We will sent x number of simultanious reuqests to the server and server will act on each request.
-Thus making x number of email acts on websites.
-No validation or rate limiting the request and taking decesions is dangerous.

2-No Rate Limit Lead to Account Take Over.
-We will send x number of simultaneous requests to the server and server will act on each request.
-Thus by sending x number of OTP we can able get the x number of request to the server.
-No validation or rate limiting the request and taking decesions is dangerous.

3-No Rate Limit Lead to Account Take Over.
-We will send x number of simultaneous requests to the server and server will act on each request.
-Thus by sending x number of right OTP and password  we can succesfully crack the otp code.(intruder)
-No validation or rate limiting the request and taking decesions is dangerous.
eg: Portswigger Lab 2FA brocken logic https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-broken-logic

4-No rate limiting protection bypass.
-We will send x number of simultaneous requests to the server and server will act on each request.
-We will do bypass for no-rate limiting using Race Condition and IPaddress.
-Thus by sending x number of right otp  taken we can successfully crack the code 
-No validation or limiting the request and taking decisions is dangerous.
eg. -https://thezerohack.com/hack-any-instagram

-Race-Condition:Whenn any user is able to sent lot of high numbero of request in a very short or small time frame.
eg: thread-100 to 200 by burp(increasing)
-Ip-Rotation: New ip address to the server.
Forging the server that request coming from different computer.

5-No rate limiting bypass using null byte.
https://hackerone.com/reports/170310
-We will do byass for no-rate limiting  using null byte adding %00 to the email,password,otp,usernam etc 
-Some Common Characters that help bypassing Rate Limit : %0d , %2e , %09 , %20 , %0, %00, %0d%0a, %0a, %0C
-keep adding %00 again.


6-No rate limiting bypass 
-We will do bypass for no rate limit using Z-Forwarded-Host: ipaddress
-Thus by sending x number of right otp token,password,we can succesfully crack the code.
-No validation or limiting the request and taking decisions is dangerous.

Adding Headers With Requests:
X-Originating: ipadd
X-Originating-IP: ipadd
X-Forwarded-For: ipadd
X-Remote-IP: ipadd
X-Remote-Addr: ipadd
X-Client-IP: ipadd
X-Host: ipadd
X-Forwarded-Host: ipadd
X-Forwarded-By: ipadd
X-Forwarded-For-Original: ipadd
X-Forwarder-For: ipadd
X-Forward-For: ipadd
Forwarded-For: ipadd
Forwarded-For-IP: ipadd
X-Custom-IP-Authorization: ipadd

ipadd --- 127.0.0.1,,,, 10.10.10.1,,,,,,, 192.168.0.1,,,,,,,, 1,,,,,,,

7-Forgot password section
-Capture forgot password or any event request using burp.
-Send to intruder or in to sequencer
-Make some request 1000 time (by adding into q=0.5)
-if application will perform some action 1000 times then there is a vulnerability.
-Note:you can change anything on the reuqest.

Test Cases:
Forgot Password.
Confirm email.
GET Request or POST Request.
Requsting for OTP.
Adding comment on poll request.
Adding comments, messeges, like buttons.
