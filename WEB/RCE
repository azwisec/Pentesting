Remote Command Execution( RCE)
Remote Command Execution is a broad term that's applied to vulnerabilities that allows
an attacker to execute arbitraty commands on the host operating system via the vulnerable
application. This can also be done by injection code into the application which could be leverage
to execute arbitrary OS commands.

Imagine an application allows its users to check for whether or not an item in stock.
This information is accessible by visiting the following URL:
https://site.com/checkitem?id=1234

However, the application fetches the above information by running the following
command in the background:
$> ./checkStock 1234
3 items available

A vulnerable application will allow an attacker to leverage this functionality by adding
additional OS commands to acheive RCE

https://site.com/checkitem?id=1234; ls

The application will take the users input and execute at the OS level in the background
and may look similar to the following:

$> ./chekStock 1234; ls

In this example, the original command to check for item 1234 is still executed as expectied, but once 
that command is finished, the application will also execute the ls command and provide its output to the attacker:

$> ./checkStock 1234; ls
3 items available
Index.php images css .htaccess


Method			Example
Command Seperators		$>./checkStock 1234; ls
(; & && | ||)		$>./checkStock 1234&& ls
			$>./checkStock 1234| ls

Bash Inline Execution		$>./checkStock 1234 $(ls)


Useful Commands		Explanation
pwd			Print Working Directory
uname			print about os
id			print current user, its group and numeric ids
hostname			print machines hostname and domain name.


In addition to executing OS commands, an attacker may be able to inject code into the application,
and leverage their code to execute arbitrary commands on the application operating system. This can be 
done in different ways such as file upload, modifying site content, debug functionalities and more.
