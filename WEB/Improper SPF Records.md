SPF stands for Sender Policy Framework, a mechanism for an email from a specific domain that can only be sent via a designated mail server. 
With this record, sending e-mail from a certain domain is only allowed from a specified mail server. If there is an email originating from that domain, 
but not from the specified mail server, the email will be rejected. With this mechanism it will reduce spam.
