Password Reset Link Not Expired After Use.

The bug name which I found was “Password Reset Link Not Expired After Use”. 
This comes under the VRT of :
“Insufficient Security Configurability >Weak Reset Password Implementation > Token Not Invalidated After Use”

Steps To Find This Bug:
1.Go to https://target.com/ password reset page.
2.Enter your email, and ask for a password reset link.
3.Now go to mail and open that link in two tabs.
4.Reset the password from one tab, reload the other tab , 
  and if it let’s you reset password again then it is vulnerable to token not invalidated after use as we are resetting the password two times with same token.
  
  
  Impact/Exploit Scenario: 
  If victim’s email account is still logged into his/her Office Computers or any public Internet Café. 
  Then any external attacker can use the used token to reset victims password.
  
  Severity: 
  Now due to this difficult to happen exploit scenario , which requires user interaction it is given as a P4 bug under Bugcrowd VRT.
