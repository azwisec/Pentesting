The impact of this vulnerability
A third party may be able to read the user credentials by intercepting an unencrypted HTTP connection.

Impact
If a user were to visit this page from a public or shared network (eg, starbucks, airport, library, etc) and submit a comment, 
a malicious user on the same network would be able to obtain that users username and password by conducting a Man-in-the-Middle attack using sslstrip and wireshark.
