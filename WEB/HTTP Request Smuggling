What is HTTP Request Smuggling?
HTTP request smuggling is an attack technique that is conducted by interfering with the processing of requests 
between the front end and back end servers. The attacker exploits the vulnerability by modifying the request to 
include another request in the first request’s body. This is done by abusing Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers. 
After the attack is successful, the second request in the first request’s body is smuggled and processed.
