  We need to know how diferrent web application interact with each other.
  This concept we learn about SOP. 
SOP is a rule(Security Mechanism) that is enforced by browsers to control access to data between web application.
If you got a Bank application and Shoping Application and by default the interaction between the two applicaion is limited.
The banking application is to able to request to the Shoping application such as eg submiting a form, but it canot read the response from the application.
This has to configure in the application because it is something that implemented by default in browser.
We cant read the data from application such as youtube, by default it is restricted.

Now let's see why this policy is implemented.
Consider the user is visiting Shoping web app and some malicious link is requesting something to your Banking application which is loged in two from the same browser and asks for your banking information.
Such as account number, balance info or your personal information. 
  Now if there is no such thing like a sop your Banking Application will share/handover to another server. This is why SOP comes to role. To prevent this browser implenent this mechanism.
