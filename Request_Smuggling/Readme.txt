What is HTTP Request Smuggling?
HTTP request smuggling is a method of attack where the attacker disrupts the processing of requests between front-end and back-end servers. The vulnerability is exploited by altering the initial request to incorporate an additional request within the body of the first one. This manipulation often involves the misuse of headers like Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding. Once the attack succeeds, the secondary request embedded in the body of the initial request is illicitly smuggled and subsequently processed.

What is front-end and back-end servers?
Front-end and back-end servers refer to different components of a software application or a web system, each serving distinct purposes in the overall functionality of the system. Let's explore the definitions of front-end and back-end servers:

Front-end:

Definition: The front-end is the user interface and presentation layer of a software application. It is the part of the system that users interact with directly.
Responsibilities:
Handling user input and interactions.
Rendering and displaying content.
Ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.
Technologies:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web applications.
User interface frameworks and libraries.

Back-end:

Definition: The back-end is the server-side of an application, which is responsible for processing requests, managing databases, and handling business logic. It's where the application's core functionality resides.
Responsibilities:
Processing and responding to user requests received from the front-end.
Managing and storing data in databases.
Executing business logic and application workflows.
Technologies:
Server-side programming languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js).
Database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Server frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django for Python; Express.js for Node.js).

Communication between Front-end and Back-end:

The front-end and back-end communicate with each other through HTTP requests. When a user interacts with the user interface (front-end), the front-end sends requests to the back-end server, which processes the requests and sends back the necessary data or updates.
Example Scenario:

A user enters data on a web form (front-end).
The front-end sends an HTTP request to the back-end server with the form data.
The back-end server processes the request, performs necessary operations (such as storing data in a database or retrieving information), and sends a response back to the front-end.
The front-end receives the response and updates the user interface accordingly.
In summary, front-end and back-end servers work together to deliver a complete and functional software application. The front-end focuses on the user interface and presentation, while the back-end handles data processing, storage, and application logic.
