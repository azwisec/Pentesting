JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) work by providing a compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web development. Here's an overview of how JWTs work:

### 1. **Structure of JWT:**

JWTs are composed of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.

- **Header:** Specifies the type of the token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used. It is Base64Url encoded.

  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
  }
  ```

- **Payload:** Contains claims (statements about an entity) and additional data. It also is Base64Url encoded.

  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "sub": "1234567890",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "admin": true
  }
  ```

- **Signature:** Created by combining the encoded Header and Payload along with a secret and then applying a signing algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA256). The Signature is used to verify the sender of the JWT and ensure that it hasn't been tampered with.


### 3. **Token Transmission:**

   - The JWT is sent to the client, usually in an HTTP header (commonly named `Authorization`) or as a parameter in the URL.

   Example:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiAiMTIzNDU2Nzg5MCIsICJuYW1lIjogIkpvaG4gRG9lIiwgImFkbWluIjogdHJ1ZSwgImlhdCI6IDE2MzExMjg2NjgsICJleHAiOiAxNjMxMTM0MjY4fQ.-XGkF0FshXzy9cZX9dENl8ffkZsPZTmwtTHkXlYgP0w
   ```

### 4. **Token Verification:**

1. **Token Reception:**
   - The server receives the JWT from the client in subsequent requests.

2. **Decoding:**
   - The server decodes the JWT by splitting it into its three parts (Header, Payload, and Signature).

3. **Signature Verification:**
   - The server recalculates the Signature using the Header, Payload, and the known secret. If the calculated Signature matches the received Signature, the JWT is considered valid.

4. **Claims Extraction:**
   - The server extracts the claims from the Payload and uses them for authentication and authorization purposes.

### 5. **Token Expiration:**

JWTs often include an expiration time (`exp` claim). Servers can enforce the expiration time to enhance security. If a token has expired, the server should reject it.

### Security Considerations:

- **Secure Transmission:**
  - JWTs should be transmitted over HTTPS to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the token.

- **Secret Management:**
  - The secret used to sign the JWT should be kept secure. It is critical to prevent unauthorized parties from creating forged tokens.

- **Token Validation:**
  - Servers must validate and verify the received tokens before trusting the claims within them.




In summary, JWTs provide a way to transmit information securely between parties, and their structure allows for easy decoding and verification on the recipient side. Proper implementation and adherence to security best practices are essential to prevent common JWT vulnerabilities.
