JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. These claims can be, for example, information about the user, their roles, or other related details. JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization purposes in web development.

Here's a breakdown of what a JWT typically consists of:
If you want to gain a better understanding of how JWTs are constructed, you can use the debugger on jwt.io to experiment with arbitrary tokens.
1. **Header:** The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "alg": "HS256",
     "typ": "JWT"
   }
   ```

2. **Payload:** The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.

   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "1234567890",
     "name": "John Doe",
     "admin": true
   }
   ```

   Common claims include `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), `sub` (subject), and `iat` (issued at).

3. **Signature:** To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

   Example:
   ```
   HMACSHA256(
     base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
     base64UrlEncode(payload),
     secret)
   ```

JWTs are often used in authentication and authorization workflows. After a user logs in, a server can generate a JWT that encodes the user's ID and any relevant roles or permissions. The server then sends this JWT to the client, which can include it in subsequent requests to prove its identity and access level.

It's important to note that while JWTs can be easily decoded, they should be validated on the server side to ensure their integrity and authenticity. The use of HTTPS is also crucial to protect the transmission of JWTs.
