PortSwigger's Web Security Academy provides interactive labs and exercises to learn about web security, including attacks on JSON Web Tokens (JWT). However, specific content and labs may have been updated or changed since then. 
Here, Portswigger explain to us how design issues and flawed handling of JSON web tokens (JWTs) can leave websites vulnerable to a variety of high-severity attacks. 

Most of the applications are commonly using the JWTs for authentication, session management, and access control mechanisms. If any sort of vulnerabilities effect in these JWTs can potentially compromise the whole application and its users.

Burp Scanner can automatically detect a number of vulnerabilities in JWT mechanisms on your behalf. For more information, see the related issue definitions on the Target > Issued definitions tab.

Here's a general overview of JWT attacks that you might find in a typical lab:
