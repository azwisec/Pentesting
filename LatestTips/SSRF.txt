Header modification results in disclosure of Slack infra metadata to unauthorized parties
Report: https://hackerone.com/reports/727330
Found files.slack.com domain will honor the X-Forwarded-Host header, instead of host header

Reproduce steps:
1. Upload a file onto the slack, find the original image path via Open original. Intercept this original path (i.e. https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TNXC4JD70-FPSL307RB/test.png) on burp suite
2. Send to repeater, make sure it works fine by clicking send directly
3. Add a header X-Forwarded-Host: xxx.com, make sure server returned 500 error
